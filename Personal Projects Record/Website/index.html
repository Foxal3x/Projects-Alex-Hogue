          <p class="intro-quotes">During the Thanksgiving season of 2021, I crafted a picture as a heartfelt gift for my mother's birthday. This image not only encapsulates her beauty, grace, resilience, her role as a devoted mother but also reveals her son &mdash;me&mdash; receiving love and inspiration from her. She loved it.

Having walked alongside my mother through her trials and triumphs as a single parent, I deeply empathize with her inner pain and material struggles. I knew my mom had <strong>many limitations</strong>, yet she became <strong>my hero</strong>. She showed me that we can create what we lack and that those who face limitations possess the boundless potential for creationâ€” to Create With Limits. This is a profound message that I am eager to <strong>share to the world</strong>.
            
With a vision to amplify Create With Limits, I turned to <strong>single&mdash;mother communities</strong>. These resilient unsung heroes embody the spirit of Create With Limits through their stories. In the pursuit of awareness, inspiration for the world, and empowerment for themselves, I launched the Single Mother Empowerment project. This journey involved interviewing these extraordinary women and transforming their life&mdash;sharing into new stories and artworks.
            
Reflecting on the strength my mother imparted, the hero my mom is to me got me questioning modern heroism. What is a hero? Is it the relentless pursuit of personal goals, the unwavering commitment to saving others, or the profound love for life even when faced with the impossible and one's limitations? In collaboration with my friend Sarah Yan, we <strong>redefine heroism</strong> and amplify the message of Create With Limits in a 126&mdash;page graphic novel.

            <p class="preview-story">The mother carries the baby against the wind.

It&rsquo;s hard for her to move even an inch, But she still left deep marks on the long grass, In order to preserve their color in a black and white world.

You know, she doesn&rsquo;t hate tailwinds and the opposite people. In fact, she like them, since it will make her life easier, But with them her baby lose the innocent blueness.

So, the mother carries the baby against the wind.</p>

            <p class="preview-story"> Laura grew up on Windless Hill. True to its name, there was no wind there. The swallows of spring never returned, and the geese never passed by. Since she was a child, Laura had longed to fly, but she had never seen a real bird. She wanted to board an airplane, but there was no airport within a hundred miles. She wanted to play with paper airplanes, but without wind, they simply couldn&rsquo;t take off. She was utterly disappointed and could only watch documentaries and educational channels on television to imagine flying. 
Many years passed, and Laura lived an ordinary life on Windless Hill for half a century. One day, her son came home crying, saying that his paper airplane couldn&rsquo;t fly all day. Without hesitation, Laura took him to the steepest slope on Windless Hill. 
She knows better than anyone that paper planes can&rsquo;t fly here, but she held her son up and dashed downhill. It was a miracle that hadn&rsquo;t happened in a hundred years. The paper airplane flew in a place without wind.</p>

She couldn&rsquo;t reach her intended destination, yet not a trace of anger mars her admiration. Though she may fall hard, she harbors no fear, for she knows her demise is not drawing near. As the sun prepares to bid its daily adieu, her spirit remains resolute, undeterred, and true, for she knows the sun shall rise again with might, guiding her flight beyond the fading light. 
Together, they shall rise with each morrow&rsquo;s birth, Perhaps to fall again, dance upon the earth. But that does not matter, for she had within her soul, The certainty that someday she&rsquo;ll reach her destination.</p>

I remember going to the McDonald&rsquo;s near the university, and my son ordered the cheapest kids&rsquo; meal. I thought I had enough money to pay, but I forgot about taxes and service charges in the U.S. The cashier was impatient, and I was on the verge of tears, but my son remained calm and said something like, &rsquo;We can eat there another time.&rsquo; In the end, I bought him even cheaper chicken nuggets.
The chicken nuggets were tiny, yet he took his time to eat them. That scene was so memorable. The window of McDonald&rsquo;s blurred the beauty outside. It was a sunny afternoon, and the trees were exceptionally green, light shined on the avenue."</p>

                <p class="full-story">      Amidst clouds of orange and a sky of purple hue, a mother descends with the setting sun in view. 
      She couldn&rsquo;t reach her intended destination, yet not a trace of anger mars her admiration. Though she may fall hard, she harbors no fear, for she knows her demise is not drawing near. As the sun prepares to bid its daily adieu, her spirit remains resolute, undeterred, and true, for she knows the sun shall rise again with might, guiding her flight beyond the fading light. 
      Together, they shall rise with each morrow&rsquo;s birth, Perhaps to fall again, dance upon the earth. But that does not matter, for she holds within her soul, The certainty that someday she&rsquo;ll reach her destination.</p>
                <p class="full-quotes">"My philosophy is simple: Things that don&rsquo;t kill you make you stronger. When I was young, my father passed away due to a terminal illness. It made me cherish life and opportunities even more.
Whenever I hear doubts, whether about my career as an educator or my life choices, I respond with a firm belief: You are not me, and I am not you. We each walk our path. Whether I&rsquo;m forty or not doesn&rsquo;t matter. Every person is unique. I hear the voices, but I move forward without hesitation! If I fall, I rise again! I am the diamond formed under immense pressure. It&rsquo;s like one of those good values in the kids&rsquo; movies, but that&rsquo;s really how my philosophy goes. haha..."

                <p class="full-story">      "In the toughest of times, when I first arrived in America, I couldn&rsquo;t even afford to treat my son to a meal at McDonald&rsquo;s. I remember going to the McDonald&rsquo;s near the university, and my son ordered the cheapest kids&rsquo; meal. I thought I had enough money to pay, but I forgot about taxes and service charges in the U.S. The cashier was impatient, and I was on the verge of tears, but my son remained calm and said something like, &rsquo;We can eat there another time.&rsquo; In the end, I bought him even cheaper chicken nuggets.
                  The chicken nuggets were tiny, yet he took his time to eat them. That scene was so memorable. The window of McDonald&rsquo;s blurred the beauty outside. It was a sunny afternoon, and the trees were exceptionally green, light shined on the avenue."</p>

      that resplendent gleams.

      that Silent cry goes unheard,
      that abyssal loneliness impends.</p>
                <p class="full-quotes">I have always been someone who pursues the beauty of life and love. Now, I have come to accept things as they are, but in the past few years, the loneliness that settled within me was truly (unbearable)..... Several years ago, whenever I interacted with others, I found that their thoughts didn&rsquo;t align with mine. It was a painful experience to live in that environment. I yearned for passionate souls, but it seemed like everyone had been worn down by life, leaving me alone for decades.

    It&rsquo;s hard for her to move even an inch, But she still left deep marks on the long grass, In order to preserve their color in a black and white world.
                  
    You know, she doesn&rsquo;t hate tailwinds and the opposite people. In fact, she like them, since it will make her life easier, But with them her baby lose the innocent blueness.

                <p class="full-quotes">"I refuse to conform to the ideologies and attitudes of others. I cannot resonate with their beliefs, yet I am unable to change them. 
  The reason that I... I am willing to walk against the wind, to separate, and to live a harder life is that I yearn for true love and want to raise my children with the right values and ideologies. It is hard to live alone, with less money and emotional support, but I am unwilling to compromise for anything. Some things, like financial security, I would rather not have than be succumbed to compromise my life..."
